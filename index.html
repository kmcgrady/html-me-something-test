                <p>My dad is from Guadalajara, Mexico and all of his family still lives there. Therefore, I get to go to Mexico at least every other year to see them but I try to go every year and they take me to different places such as the beach so I can know different places.</p>

                <p>During my 2015-2016 school year I went on an exchange program to live in Bern, Switzerland for 11 months. I had the chance to live with two different host families and go to the local school there. I also had to learn German because that was the language they spoke, after my year there I was pretty much fluent in German.</p>

                <p>During my time in Switzerland my first host family took me to Bordeux, France for a week and also to the vineyards around to try differnt wines. Also on my exchange we were able to go on a Euro Tour and one of the places we went to was Paris where we were able to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.</p>
