                <h2>Step One - The very first step in creating an HTML file</h2>
                <p>Like with many aspects of coding, creating an HTML page requires the use of  text editor. Go ahead and fire up your favorite. While many people in class like to use <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com'>Visual Studio Code</a>, I prefer to use the open source program <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>.</p>

                <p>Look at that, a nice blank page. This could be used for any language, really, but we will be writing good old HTML!</p>

                <h2>Step 2 - Really getting started</h2>
                    <p>What use is a text editor if there's no text? To get us started, Atom ca be pretty useful. By simply typing <code>html</code> into the editor, the boilerplate of an HTML page is automatically generated. This can be particularly useful for beginers, as it shows the basic layout of an HTML page as well as the head and doctype elements.</p>
                    <img src="images/boilerplate.png" alt="Boilerplate HTML" />
                    <p>There we go, one fresh set of boilerplate. Now we are ready to move on to the next step...</p>

                <h2>Step 3 - Even more HTML!</h2>
                <p>The boilerplave that we generated is a good starting point, but it certainly isn't the end goal. If we were to open our browser to the page we just generated, with nothing but the boilerplate, we would see a completley blank page. To put out content in, we need to use tags. Tags are the snippets of code that include and are between angle brackets, like <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. Below we can see an HTML page that includes a lot of different tags for different sorts of content. These new tags include the unordered list tag <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, the heading tags<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and the paragraph tag <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. All of these tags combine together to express content in different ways, for different purposes. For an overview of many of the different HTML tags available, please see W3Schools' <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">HTML Tag List</a>.</p>
                <img src="images/atom-with-more.png" alt="Atom with even more HTML" />
                <p> Also notice that some of the code is surrounded by the comment markers <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>. Any code or text that is between these markers are not iterpreted by the browser, which can make it very useful when trying new code or bug fixing to isolate code.</p>

                <h2>Step 4 - Checking Your Work</h2>
                <p>Okay, now let's check and see what our page looks like in the browser:</p>
                <img src="images/opera-raw-html-image.png" alt="Checking how the HTLM file looks in the browser" />
                <p>Looks like all the content we included is shown on the page, but it doesn't look very appealing. That will change when we get a chance to look at <a href="#step-5">Step 5</a>.</p>

                <h2>Step 5 - Adding Some Style</h2>
                <p>Okay, now that we have our content written and showing up correcly in the browser, we can go ahead and adjust how that content looks. We do that by employing <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> code into our page. To do this, we need to add the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag to the head of the document. For example, in this page the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag points to an external CSS file called <code>styles.css</code>. To do that, we expand the attributes of the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag so it looks like this:</p>
                <p id="style_link"><code>&lt;link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='styles.css' /&gt;</code></p>
                <p>From there, we can then begin coding our new file, <code>styles.css</code>. You can get a good overview of what sort of thins CSS can do by looking at W3Schools' <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp">CSS Reference</a>. See below what the CSS looks like in the Atom text editor.</p>
                <img src="images/css-in-atom.png" alt="Atom with some CSS on it.">
                <p>Just looking at the code in the text editor, it can be a bit confusing to see if the code is doing what you inteded. That's why it is important to constanly be checking what the page looks like in a browser window. You will see below how this example page looks when rendered by the browser, now that the page has CSS.</p>
                <img src="images/browser-html-with-css.png" alt="Screenshot of browser with css in there as well">
                <p>There we go! Looks pretty good. At least, quite a bit better than it did without CSS. Now that we have our HTML and CSS done, we can go ahead and get to the last and most involved step: <a href="#step-6">Step 6</a>.</p>

            <hr />
            <article class="news-post" id="step-6">
                <h2>Step 6 - Revise, Revise, and Revise Again</h2>
                <p>This is the step in the development process that always takes the longest, and never really seems to be complete. Go ahead and go into your <code>index.html</code> file and catch any typos, badly worded phrases, or make changes as you see fit. The end of the project is when you decide it it.</p>
                <p>Likewise, don't be afraid to go into <code>styles.css</code> and make changes. Perhaps the <code>background-color</code> you  picked for the <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tag should be green instead of orange. Perhaps the <code>padding-top</code> of the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags in the <code>magic-bean</code> class should be <code>15px</code> rather than <code>25px</code>. There are so many different ways that your code can be displayed, and there is no one right way to do it.</p>
                <p>Once you've tweaked your code to a point that you are happy with it, go ahead and submit it and give yourself a pat on the back. You earned it!</p>
